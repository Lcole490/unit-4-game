### Crystal Collector Game


## How The Game Works
- At the start of the game, the computer randomly generates a target number and 4 gems appear at the bottom of the screen. There is also a separate score for the user that defaults to 0. 
-Each of the gems has a value between 1 and 12. The value of a particular gem is a mystery to the user until it is clicked. Upon clicking a gem, the value of the gem is added to the user's score. Each gem holds their value for the entirety of the game. 
- The goal of the game is for the user to get their score to match the target score exactly. They will do this by clicking the gems in combination to achieve the target score.
- If the user's score matches the target, the user wins the game.
- If the user's score is greater than the target, the user loses the game.
- The user can refresh the screen to start a new game. With every new game, a new target number is randomly generated and each gem receives a new "mystery" value.
